# Config

The `config.yml` has a bunch of options for editing the behaviour of your server, such as setting the election system.

In the config, youll find a bunch of stuff. it is explained inside of the config.

you can see the full default config below&#x20;

```yml
# ============================================================================
#  TownyElections - Configuration
# ============================================================================
#  A formal, configurable election system for Towny towns.
#  Documentation & support: see README.md
# ============================================================================

# Do not edit. Used internally to migrate the config on updates.
config-version: 1

# General plugin settings.
general:
  # Locale for the messages file (messages_<locale>.yml). Defaults to "en".
  locale: "en"
  # If true, extra debug information is logged to the console.
  debug: false
  # Enable anonymous usage statistics via bStats (https://bstats.org).
  metrics: true

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Update checker
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# On startup, TownyElections can check GitHub Releases for a newer *stable* version
# (beta and alpha versions are ignored). The check runs asynchronously and never
# blocks the server; it only logs to the console and, optionally, notifies
# admins on join. It never downloads or installs anything.
update-checker:
  # Master switch for the GitHub Releases update check.
  enabled: true
  # GitHub repository in owner/name form.
  github-repository: "vingaming1113/TownyElections"
  # Notify players with townyelections.admin when they join if an update exists.

#  Election settings
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
election:
  # How long the *nomination/campaign* phase lasts, during which residents may
  # register as candidates. Accepts a duration such as: 30s, 10m, 2h, 3d, 1w.
  nomination-duration: "2d"

  # How long the *voting* phase lasts once nominations close.
  voting-duration: "3d"

  # Minimum number of candidates required for an election to proceed to voting.
  # If fewer candidates register, the election is cancelled (or auto-wins, see
  # "auto-win-single-candidate").
  min-candidates: 2

  # Maximum number of candidates permitted per election. 0 = unlimited.
  max-candidates: 0

  # If only a single candidate registers and min-candidates would otherwise
  # fail, should that candidate automatically win?
  auto-win-single-candidate: true

  # Minimum number of residents a town must have before an election may run.
  min-town-residents: 2

  # Each resident may cast this many votes per election (usually 1).
  votes-per-resident: 1

  # If true, players may change their vote while the voting phase is open.
  allow-vote-changes: true

  # If true, residents can see live vote tallies during voting. If false, tallies
  # are hidden until the election concludes (secret ballot).
  public-live-results: true

  # May candidates vote for themselves?
  allow-self-vote: false

  # Electoral system used to collect and count ballots:
  #   PLURALITY      - each voter picks one candidate; the most votes wins
  #   RANKED_CHOICE  - voters rank candidates in order of preference
  #                    (/election vote First Second Third ...). Counting runs
  #                    instant-runoff rounds: the weakest candidate is
  #                    eliminated and their ballots transfer to each voter's
  #                    next preference until someone holds a majority.
  #   APPROVAL       - voters approve any number of candidates
  #                    (/election vote Alice Bob ...); most approvals wins
  # The system is locked in when an election starts; changing this value never
  # re-interprets the ballots of an already-running election.
  voting-system: "PLURALITY"

  # Tie-breaking strategy when the top candidates are tied:
  #   RANDOM         - pick a random winner from the tied candidates
  #   EARLIEST       - the candidate who registered first wins
  #   INCUMBENT      - the current mayor wins if tied, else RANDOM
  #   RUNOFF         - start a new short voting round between the tied candidates
  #   NONE           - declare no winner (election voided)
  tie-breaker: "RUNOFF"

  # Duration of a runoff voting round (only used when tie-breaker is RUNOFF).
  runoff-duration: "1d"

  # Automatically start a new election in every eligible town on a fixed cadence.
  # Set enabled to false to only run elections started manually via commands.
  auto-schedule:
    enabled: true
    # Cadence between the *end* of one election and the automatic start of the
    # next (per town). Example: 30d for a monthly cycle.
    interval: "14d"

  # If true, the town's economy account is charged/rewards handled (requires an
  # economy). Purely optional flavour.
  economy:
    # Cost for a resident to register as a candidate. 0 = free.
    candidacy-cost: 10.0
    # Reward paid to the winner from nowhere (0 = disabled).
    winner-reward: 500.0

  # Per-IP vote limit to prevent alt abuse. When enabled, one account per
  # fingerprint can obtain a ballot, up to the configured number of fingerprints.
  # IP addresses are hashed (SHA-256); only the hashes and voter UUIDs are saved
  # so the protection remains effective after a server restart.
  ip-vote-limit:
    # Master switch for the per-IP vote limit. false = disabled (current behavior).
    enabled: false
    # Maximum number of distinct IP fingerprints allowed to vote in one election.

  # Maximum length (characters) of a party name typed with /election party.
  # This protects chat output and tab completion from very long labels.
  max-party-name-length: 32
  # Default party shown until a candidate chooses one.
  # This is what players return to when they use /election party leave.

  # result summaries. Candidates still keep the label in candidate lists.
  hide-default-party-from-standings: false

  # 0 = unlimited. This only limits creating brand-new party labels; players
  # may always join a party that already exists or leave back to the default.
  max-parties: 0
  # If true, candidates cannot change their campaign message, profile, party, or
  # party colour once the voting phase has begun. These can only be edited during
  # the nomination phase. Set to false to allow edits at any time.

#  Winner rewards - what the elected candidate receives
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When an election concludes, the winner is granted the configured Towny town
# ranks and (optionally) is made mayor. Ranks must exist in Towny's

#  Command customization
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rename the sub-commands of /election to whatever suits your server. The keys

# Example: set parties: "blocs" to make /election blocs list party standings.
# Keep each literal unique so commands can be resolved unambiguously.
